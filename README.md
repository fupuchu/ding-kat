### WDI Unit 3 Post Mortem

### 1. What habits did we use during this unit that helped me?

Google, git stash , how to manage expectations of group members.

### 2. What habits did we have during this unit that we can improve on?

Open discussion on certain topics and during the planning stages.

Would be good to explore what rails does behind the background and starting with Ruby first would have helped.
